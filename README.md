# Dotfiles & Themes

## Introduction

My dotfiles repo. Here are the configurations for the programs I use.  

Credit to Antonio Sarosi ([@antoniosarosi](https://github.com/antoniosarosi)), 
this feels more like a fork  
of his dotfiles rather than my own dotfiles. See his dotfiles here:  
`https://github.com/antoniosarosi/dotfiles`

> Note:  
A [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com) is also needed for symbol support. 
I'm currently using  
[JetBrains Mono Nerd Font](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#jetbrainsmono), but any font with the symbols that are used  
in these scripts should work fine.
