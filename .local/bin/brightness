Usage: $programName [OPTION] [NUMBER]

Show or adjust laptop's screen brightness.

Options:
  -h, --help            display this help and exit
  -f, --full            shows brightness with a corresponding icon and sends
                        a notification
  -n, --notification    sends a notification showing the brightness
  -s, --simple          shows brightness as an integer in range [0, 100]

Valid number format:
      n       sets brightness to n%
  +n, n+      increases brightness to (current + n)%
  -n, n-      decreases brightness to (current - n)%

'n' must be an integer in range [0, 100].
'n' can be followed by '%' if desired.

When no arguments are passed brightness with the corresponding icon is shown.
